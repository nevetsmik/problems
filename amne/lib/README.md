# Time and space complexity

The function increasingDecreasingSubrangeDifference has time complexity O(n - K + 1) * k), which simplifies to O(n). There are two nested loops in the function. The outer function runs for n - K + 1, which is the number of windows in the range. The inner function runs k times, the size of the window. Space complexity is O(1) when the answers are consoled to the command line. 

# General strategy

The basic idea is to use a greedy approach to count the increasing and decreasing subranges:
1. Calculate difference between neighboring pairs to determine the current trend.
2. Keep track of the number of previous repeating decreasing or increasing pairs to count the number of ranges that should be added to the increasing or decreasing count.
3. Update the previous trend for the next iteration.
